# Impact Classifier

Impact classifier is a project that proposes to leverage machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build a text classifier that automatizes the processing and identification of evidence of social impact in research documents. 

The proposal aims to solve a classification problem in which the model takes a sentence contained in a research document as input and produces as output a binary answer (1=True, 0=False) that states whether the sentence contains or not evidence of social impact, respectively.


## Case Study

From all research fields, this project focuses on Medical, Health, and Biological science because the ultimately goal is to understand the social impact of the research projects of the Spanish National Institue of Bioinformatics (INB by its Spanish Acronym), which is an institution that conducts medical and biological investigations.
