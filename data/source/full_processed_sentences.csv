The research has inspired young people teachers and the general public internationally to follow cosmological developments,1
In the last decade sport has earned unprecedented recognition in international policy circles as a tool to support international development,1
Nonetheless many have challenged this new social movement Kidd concerned by its uncritical application of Global North models of sport to Global South contexts,1
Addressing these concerns Brunel researchers and collaborators have drawn on the field of international development studies to investigate how principles of local ownership and partnership can be applied to sport,1
Since empirical studies and critical conceptual analyses have contributed to this,1
Specifically through building organisational capacity at local level supporting partnership between funders and recipient organisations and developing national as well as international policy guidance to ensure community level experiences and perspectives are represented in sport for development policy and strategies,1
Tucker s ethnographic research on the social worlds inhabited by township Men who have Sex with Men MSM and his quantitative analysis of the associations between social and psycho social conditions and risky sexual practices for such men led to the development of the innovative Ukwazana HIV prevention programme the first of its kind in Africa,1
Ukwazana meaning getting to know each other in isiXhosa is based across the central townships of Cape Town and is unique in fostering partnerships with marginalised township MSM engaging them collaboratively in HIV prevention initiatives,1
Based on Tucker s research findings it is the first scheme to recognise and tackle social and psychosocial factors such as homophobia depression and loss of self esteem which often result in risky sexual practices and related illnesses among MSM,1
This new approach was timely since despite numerous previous HIV prevention campaigns aimed at township MSM HIV prevalence for this group was three times the national average,1
Jacqueline Barnes evaluations of government initiatives promoting parenting and child development for vulnerable families have directly affected major policy decisions since,1
Her study of the Home Start programme demonstrated limited benefits of unstructured volunteer support and informed recent NICE guidance on early intervention,1
Her subsequent evaluation of the Family Nurse Partnership FNP programme for vulnerable mothers changed government policy,1

This research programme has provided convincing evidence that fish perceive pain and has been instrumental in directly informing changes to experimental protocols and influencing welfare guidelines,1
We use fish in a variety of ways for food farming experimentation as public exhibits in recreational angling and as pets,1
Many of the procedures that fish are subjected to cause tissue damage that would give rise to the sensation of pain in mammals,1
This research programme uses techniques in neurobiology physiology and animal behaviour to discover how the fish are affected by these procedures,1
This has not only improved the welfare of fish but also influenced how the public views these animals through media dissemination,1
Bullying occurs when pupils persist in being physically or psychologically abusive to less powerful peers,1
While it used to be seen as just part of growing up and character building it is now recognised as a serious societal problem that demands attention and schools must take active steps to combat it,1
Professor Boulton s research contributed to this shift and has ensured bullying continues to be taken seriously,1
His work has produced novel findings on the damaging psychological impact of bullying why pupils become involved and has guided policy and advice offered by governments in the U K U S and elsewhere and by other national bodies NSPCC,1
Marco Manacorda s research on social assistance programmes has been a major influence on the design and evaluation of a flagship poverty alleviation initiative in Uruguay known as PANES,1

Key Bold text from REF guidelines Bold italic italic emphasis Superscript references in sections and Research by Chadwick has influenced research protocols and policies regarding the ethical consequences of collecting DNA for research,1
Her impact is most visible in the Personal Genome Project and the work of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics UN Food and Agriculture Organisation Human Genome Project and H Africa,1
Her contributions to discussions and documents resulted in changes to how consent is gained from DNA donors,1
In particular the changes address important issues that she raised regarding the practicality and acceptability of the undertakings made in current consent protocols about confidentiality and the future use of data,1
Chadwick s underpinning research claims relate to the fact that genetic information and the attendant genetic technology are derived from and significant to populations as a whole,1
She maintains that biotechnological advances are changing our ethical values particularly regarding conflicts between personal interests and large group needs,1
For her practical ethics cannot apply normative ethical concepts and theories arising from abstract philosophical reasoning,1
Rather the conceptual and theoretical structures themselves must be developed through philosophical engagement with the scientific details of the project,1
Her collaboration with bodies responsible for the protocols of consent reflects a bottom up moral philosophy rather than the traditional top down theory driven approach,1
Research into the prevalence of workplace bullying and stress conducted between March and December in New Zealand has had three main impacts,1
The research findings highlight the importance of psychosocial issues in workplaces and directly contributed to the New Zealand Government s decision to include psychosocial workplace hazards as a priority in the Occupational Health Action Plan to,1
Data from the research is one of the main factual bases for a new guideline developed by staff in the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment on workplace bullying,1
The guidelines made the research findings available to Health and Safety Inspectors and Professionals Unions and Employer Groups as well as presenting practices for Occupational Safety and Health Fact Sheets for preventing and dealing with bullying at work,1
There are an increasing numbers of people living into very old age,1
At the same time there is a drive to enable people to live within their own homes for as long as possible,1
Consequently health and social care services that previously would have experienced very few people with dementia now have this as part of their core function,1
Yet there is no tradition in these services of supporting people with dementia and there are many reports of inadequate care,1
For example Valleley reports that over half of people living in extra care housing with dementia were admitted to other care settings during the first two years due to challenging behaviour conflicts with staff and other residents and distress on the part of the person with dementia i Similarly hospital patients with acute and chronic medical conditions concomitant with dementia are consistently reported to experience poorer quality outcomes than patients with similar conditions without dementia ii The research described below has had significant benefits for those living with dementia both in extra care housing and in hospital settings primarily at the national level but also internationally,1
It has enhanced quality of life for individuals living with dementia improved the practice of professionals working with people with dementia and had economic benefits,1
Dementia poses substantial public health and societal challenges for Europe as there is currently no cure and it is estimated that million Europeans will be living with the disease in,1
Good quality information allows for decision makers to establish appropriate health policies and target resources where they are needed and where they are effective,1
The ALCOVE project established a European network where knowledge on dementia could be shared and developed a series of recommendations for improving dementia care and quality of life across Europe,1
A particular strand of research within the project on timely diagnosis of dementia led by Worcester s Association for Dementia Studies has already stimulated policy debate on this issue in the UK and elsewhere in Europe while a toolbox developed through the project for those living with dementia and their carers and for health and social care professionals has informed care practice,1
Dr Sunil Amrith s research has enhanced understanding of the historical roots of many contemporary policy problems making him a leading expert on the history of public health in South and Southeast Asia,1

Stroke is the leading cause of disability in Europe,1
There are around million stroke survivors in the UK,1
More than half have been left with disabilities that affect their daily life,1
The annual cost of stroke to the UK economy was billion,1
Clinical response to stroke has often focused on resulting physical disabilities but cognitive disability can be an equally substantial source of difficulty for patients and their carers,1
Sensitive and reliable assessment of cognitive disability following stroke is essential for identifying these needs in patients and early assessment is a major benefit because problems soon after stroke are a strong prognostic indicator of future problems and appropriate rehabilitation is most effective when started early,1
Founded on longstanding expertise in neuropsychological studies the University of Birmingham group has developed a comprehensive stroke specific screening tool the BCoS which enables early and efficient detection of cognitive impairment after a stroke for a wider range of patients than is possible with existing methods,1
Through this development and its associated training programme the BCoS is changing the way stroke survivors are assessed in the UK and internationally and it is influencing practice in other areas such as traumatic brain injury,1
The worst of institutional child care came to the attention of the public and policy makers in the s following the fall of Ceau escu in when pictures of children in Romanian orphanages were broadcast around Europe and America,1
Following this a series of projects at the University of Birmingham funded by the European Union Daphne programme and the World Health Organisation Regional Office for Europe charted the extent and consequences of institutionalised care for children across Europe and devised best practice recommendations for deinstitutionalisation,1
Among the key findings were that institutionalisation was much more widespread across the EU than previously thought that it is particularly harmful before the age of three and that alternative care with superior outcomes for children is also less expensive to implement,1
During the REF period the research team has significantly expanded their role in disseminating their findings producing policy reports and briefings and in providing training,1
During this time their key findings have made a major contribution to changes in child care policy recommendations by NGOs such as UNICEF and the UN,1
Following discussion at the UN General Assembly in specific guidelines were produced for all member states which implemented key recommendations from the research about the timing of deinstitutionalisation and how to achieve it Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children,1
Their research has led to changes to national child care policies in a number of countries including the Czech Republic Hungary and Serbia,1
Through the activity of UNICEF the impact is now extending beyond Europe to central and South America,1
These changes have demonstrable benefits for the health and psychological welfare of children as well as bringing cost savings to the national childcare systems that implement them,1
Widespread concern about the effects of excess alcohol consumption by young people has been the focus of extensive national debate,1
The drinks industry has paid growing attention to these issues corporate social responsibility measures by both individual companies and industry bodies show evidence of a more sophisticated appreciation of how marketing can be used to address the problem,1
This is evident in publications of the major drinks companies and the continual updating of recommendations to industry by the Portman Group,1
Findings from research into young people alcohol consumption and social identity research have informed public policy and industry debates and have shaped control measures in particular by highlighting the social versus individual responsibility issues around so called binge drinking,1
Professor Isabelle Szmigin of Birmingham Business School a lead researcher on this project has subsequently been directly involved in enhancing corporate social responsibility activities within the alcohol industry through industry and policy wide debates such as a St George s House consultation on alcohol and has been appointed as one of nine members of the Portman Group Independent Complaints Panel which adjudicates on complaints made under the industry Code of Practice on the marketing of alcoholic products in the UK,1

Some UK children show persistent antisocial behaviour Conduct Disorder a major mental health problem in childhood with strong continuity to adult substance misuse violence and criminality,1
Research at King s College London KCL showed that these children cost the public ten times more than individuals without Conduct Disorder by age,1
To tackle the problem KCL researchers were the first to demonstrate that a rigorous parenting programme is a highly effective treatment even for severe cases,1
KCL leads the National Academy for Parenting Research which has trained practitioners in these approaches who are estimated to have treated troubled children,1
This success has contributed to the programmes being recommended in NICE guidance and incorporated in a new nation wide Department of Health funded rollout reaching of year olds in England,1
The training has also been disseminated internationally,1
Eating disorders affect of young people and in many cases persist into adulthood,1
At their most severe they can evoke intense emotional responses from those closest to the person,1
King s College London KCL research established that the response from others combined with personal factors and beliefs were key maintaining factors in the disorder,1
As a result KCL researchers developed self help materials that reduced distress and improved carers ability to manage the person they were helping,1
This intervention programme has been adapted into a workshop a self help book a DVD and a clinical handbook,1
The programme has been adopted by two of the largest UK eating disorder charities BEAT and SUCCEED and is recommended by the USA based international charity FEAST and forms the basis of local NHS and international services including in the USA and Australia,1
Armed Forces personnel are twice as likely to die on the road as civilians and around times more likely to report alcohol misuse,1
Evidence from King s College London KCL has helped highlight these issues and led to the development of specific post deployment interventions for service personnel in order to mitigate the impact of deployment on driving behaviour and alcohol use,1
Delivered during post deployment decompression as a result of KCL research these interventions have been mandatorily provided to up to service personnel returning from deployment and have led to a significant reduction in road traffic deaths,1

Research conducted by Professor Wrigley of the University of Southampton has had a major impact on retail sector practices and government retail policy,1
Retail is a key sector of the economy,1
Gross value added GVA by the sector has risen by over in real terms over the past years,1
Wrigley s research established the key role of food retail in disadvantaged communities as a tool for both urban regeneration and a response to the obesity epidemic,1
Its impact has reset the parameters of policy debate on retail competition and contributed to both the evidence base and policy formulation on the future of the high street in the face of case of economic crisis and changing retail practices,1
These impacts have had national and global reach on UK and US government policies and have been significant in the launch of a large scale experiment to eradicate food deserts areas lacking healthy foods in Philadelphia,1
The impacts have also been instrumental in convincing the retail industry of the value of academic research,1
In Autumn Dr Stephen Bullivant was appointed Director of the European Society for Catholic Theology s research project into the nature function and location of theology with particular attention to the power of theology to overcome power abuse in Church and Society InSpiRe and with a special focus on the nature and causes of clerical sexual abuse,1
Given the gravity and urgency of the topic the project s impact aims have been to engage two particular non academic audiences the Catholic hierarchy and those involved in setting church policy regarding safeguarding and the handling of abuse allegations and the wider Catholic public i e the Church as a whole,1
Its intention is to introduce both to the wealth of academic research being conducted in this area and from which the Church can and must learn,1
Although the research project was only recently concluded and several of the main outputs have yet to appear a significant amount of both kinds of impact has even at this very early stage already occurred,1
Since the project launch in September major figures from the world of Catholic safeguarding at both national and international levels have been involved in various ways,1
Most notably the Vatican s own chief prosecutor of abuse allegations has described the project as constituting an important moment to move from the hierarchy to the theologians for proper reflection on this most tragic wound in the Church and in society Vatican Radio a b see section below,1
The project has also received notable coverage from the international Catholic media,1
The further development of the UK Physical Activity guidelines in highlighted the need to consider the emerging research in the area of sedentary behaviour,1
Prof S Biddle at Loughborough University based upon his and the Unit s leading research in this area was invited to Chair a working group to review and make recommendations regarding the incorporation of guidance on sedentary behaviour into these new national policies,1
This group drawing on the original work of Biddle and co workers set out clear recommendations for the incorporation of sedentary behaviour into the UK national Physical Activity Guidelines through the Sedentary Behaviour and Obesity Review of the Current Scientific Evidence report,1
Physical Activity guidelines in the UK had never included recommendations for sedentary behaviour until the publication of Start Active Stay Active as a direct result of the Unit s research,1
