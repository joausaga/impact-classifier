1524,"We believe, variations in samples will be the reason of differences between our and the other studies, as their experiment was carried out on PIK3CA exons such as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 18, 20, which were included intron-exon boundaries and their method were based on PCR as well as gene sequencing of exons so it can be the cause of inconsistency with our research."
