398,after prolonged treatment with these pharmacological agents a differentiated phenotype was observed in both cellular models
399,importantly we found ki67 levels to be independent of pik3ca mutation status or other alterations in the pathway suggesting that selecting cohorts of patients based on pathway activation would not necessarily identify low risk patients with non proliferative cancers
400,by contrast the bispecific tab6 induces less her3 degradation than either ab6 or ab6tet and yet is more effective in reducing cell signaling and proliferation
401,furthermore in vitro model systems were used to study the functional role of lsr in breast cancer cell behavior
402,all women who undergo mammography screening using digital equipment during the study period at the study centres will be included

407,panel shows the correlation plots for each of the 10 assays with the pearson s correlation indicated for each
408,patient information tumor samples used in the study were collected from the first affiliated hospital of dalian medical university china
409,in case of cancer cell invasion blocking such targets might lead to the confinement of the primary tumour to its original site reducing cancer to a local and more curable problem
410,several mechanisms were proposed to explain the role of ar in this transition to therapy resistance
411,lncap and du145 prostate cancer cells are resistant to trail induced apoptosis and trail was less active against them compares with pc 3 prostate cancer cells 29  30
412,their low sensitivity to currently used kinase inhibitors supports this idea 40 42 43
413,after reaching 90% confluency hc11 strains were starved for 48 h before conditioned medium was collected concentrated and analyzed by zymography as described 86
414,interestingly it has been shown that cells vary in their susceptibility to heat in accordance to their phase in the cell cycle with the highest heat sensitivity observed during mitosis due to damage to the mitotic apparatus leading to inefficient mitosis and polyploidy
415,figure 4 pedigrees of 11 selected non brca1 2 families included in this study
416,both during routine and expert reading addition of breast mri allowed better discrimination between benign and malignant disease with auc s increasing from 0 76 to 0 81 with routine mri reading and from 0 76 to 0 87 for expert reading
417,photographs show a the extensive staining score 1  b localized dispersion of staining score 2  and c minimal dispersion of staining score 3
418,to be considered as differentially expressed between hc11 fl and hc11 mutb1 or hc11 sap cells genes had to pass the filters adjusted p value
419,all the patients participated in the study were diagnosed as non small cell lung cancers histologically
420,at multivariate analysis only gs and pathologic stage were independent predictors of br
421,thus transthoracic fine needle aspiration or biopsy can be considered in pulmonary adenocarcinoma
422,in addition pc is multifocal exhibiting different histopathological patterns graded from 1 to 5 gleason grades
423,the routine use of vats for the treatment of respectable metastatic lung cancer remains controversial
424,lung tumor size malignancy and associated morbidity were significantly increased in arf
425,this suggested complement just like a double edged sword plays a dual role in carcinogenesis
426,the statistical power was insensitive to the choice of f in the range of 0 01 0 1 62
427,although additional studies are required to confirm some associations sufficient information is available for some risk factors to be used in risk counseling or lifestyle modification to minimize cancer risk in brca1 2 mutation carriers
428,the analysis was performed by using cut off values obtained by maximal chi squared methods
429,in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma patients with a discrepancy in lesion size of more than 1 cm between mammography and ultrasound and patients eligible for partial breast irradiation in whom the clinical benefit of preoperative breast mri is more clear 8
430,in these cells the early effect on dnmt3 depletion and gene methylation was evident within 72 hours of treatment 19
431,the response rate for patients was 94%
432,excellent staining was achieved in 17 subjects 81% with mlm and 8 38% with methylene blue p 0 011
433,however the mechanisms by which glutamic acid decarboxylase allows organisms to survive acidic stress remains unclear
434,seven days later the spheres were dissociated and the number of viable cells was evaluated
435,sensitivity analysis performed by omitting one study at a time identified the main source of heterogeneity as the study by inoue et al
436,non migrated cells in the top chamber were removed
437,data represents the mean s d  of 2 independent experiments performed in triplicate
438,after removing nocodazole more mirzip 182 than mirzip cells remained in g2 m phase providing further evidence that mir 182 positively regulates cell cycle progression figure 3b
439,we therefore set out to investigate the intracellular localisation of pde4d7 in vcap cells
440,data are expressed in fold ar basal activity which was set to 1
441,the plasmid ptor2 scfv that encodes an scfv fragment specific to msln and the recombinant p4 scfv protein 13  generated and purified from yeast were generous gifts from dr nathalie scholler penn ovarian cancer research center university of pennsylvania
442,reported that black tea consumption was positively associated with the risk of er pr  breast cancer suggesting a possible carcinogenic role involving sex hormones 61
443,on the other hand molecules targeting cancer stem cells are investigated
444,for the subgroup of patients not hospitalised for pca these frequencies were 20% 12% and 5% respectively

448,pax6 expression in lung cancer tissue was higher than that in each matched adjacent normal tissue in all but three cases figure 6b
449,no significant differences in survival were observed between spring and winter hr 1 035 95% ci 1 028 to 1 042 p 0 15 or fall and winter hr 1 004 95% ci 0 997 to 1 011 p 0 87 for prostate cancer diagnoses
450,although anthracycline based anticancer chemotherapies failed in t cell deficient mice they successfully reduced the growth of cancers developing in mice lacking b lymphocytes due to the injection of a b cell depleting anti cd20 antibody  immunoglobulins igs or ig receptors fc receptor due to genetic manipulations
451,if you choose not to take part in this survey it will not affect the care you receive from the nhs in any way
452,the use of chemotherapy correlated inversely with age at diagnosis p  0 001 mannwhitney
453,e scfvmtbhsp70 enhanced tumor cell immunogenicity in vivo
454,gapdh 10  slug and snail 17
455,a total of 124 snap frozen transrectal ultrasound trus  guided biopsies were acquired from 47 men with untreated prostate cancer and from 39 men with a rising psa and recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy
456,with regard to ct attenuation the highest odds ratio 12 4 was obtained at a cutoff value of 680 hu and the sensitivity and specificity were 95 8% and 35 1% respectively with an auc of 0 77 figure 2
457,the group of patients who were given the full explanation had a 7 2% higher quit rate than the control group 14
458,casc1 which is frequently co amplified with kras in lung tumors is essential for microtubule polymerization and satisfaction of the spindle assembly checkpoint
459,in our study the treatment groups will consist of 14 people of whom about 7 will be patients
460,the assay is currently only available in centralized laboratories and is much more expensive than ihc
461,the genes that were differentially expressed at statistically significant levels included those involved in spindle assembly and chromosome separation chromosome condensation in prometaphase metaphase checkpoint sister chromatid cohesion and initiation of mitosis
462,this accounts for the highly lethal effects of carbon ions even on radioresistant with respect to x rays tumors
463,previous groups have shown ar induced de novo lipogenesis which is enhanced during the emergence of androgen independence to contribute to the survival growth of crpc cells swinnen et al 1997 ettinger et al 2004
464,importantly and of direct relevance to therapy the bispecific antibody is a more potent inhibitor of signaling and growth than either her2 or her3 specific antibodies alone or a mixture of antibodies of both specificities
465,next we generated gene lists by randomly selecting genes from the gene universe
466,effective treatment which can sensitize the radioresistant nsclc to radiotherapy is always being sought
