Changing people's perceptions of the human:animal relationship
","
The Cardiff Osteological Research Group (CORG) has researched the complex relationship
between animals and people, across Britain, Europe and beyond. CORG has taken its research as
the basis for a programme of activities that seeks to challenge modern attitudes to animals through
archaeological studies, and to provoke reflection on the present relevance and future development
of animals. Their impact has built on relationships developed with artists and practitioners in
creative industries who have been influenced by the issues researched. By encouraging a range of
audiences to consider the economic, social, ritual and symbolic roles of animals, CORG has
enriched, informed and changed the perspectives of individuals who do not normally engage with
the archaeological past, including target groups traditionally excluded from, or not aware of,
academic research.

Every week, criminal firesetting in the UK causes 65 casualties or deaths (3,380 per year) and
costs &#163;42 million (&#163;2.2 billion per year; Arson Prevention Bureau, 2009). Remarkably, no
standardised offender treatment programmes have been developed for this common, costly and
tragic offence. Responding to this need, psychologists from the School of Psychology at the
University of Kent have recently developed the first empirically informed comprehensive theory of
firesetting, and from their theory, they have derived the first standardised treatment programmes
for firesetters. Already, the research is being used across the UK and Australia in the training,
assessment, and treatment practices of clinical professionals who work with adult firesetters.
Clinicians in the USA have also been trained in a treatment programme derived from the research.
As a result, enhanced, specialised treatment of firesetters is being provided in secure
establishments and community settings for the first time. Further, the assessment and treatment
programmes developed by our researchers now play a central role in the care, sentence planning
and parole decisions for firesetters in the UK.

    Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) is a strategy for rehabilitation,
      equalisation of opportunity, poverty reduction and social inclusion of
      people with disabilities in low and middle income countries. Outcomes from
      CBR have been shown to increase independence, and enhance mobility and
      social inclusion of people with disabilities in low and middle income
      nations. CBR is currently implemented in over 90 countries and has enabled
      thousands of disabled children and adults across the globe to receive
      rehabilitative care within their own communities. CBR works by
      establishing community-based programmes which reach into areas that
      conventional services cannot, such as rural areas in developing countries
      with limited infrastructure; it is able to do this as programme leadership
      is not restricted to professionals but also involves the people with
      disabilities, their families and communities. Hartley has played a
      significant role in providing the evidence required by governments and
      NGOs to implement CBR to enable children and adults in developing
      countries to benefit from improved communication, education and community
      development. Hartley provided research evidence to help the approach

    The law regulating social care services for disabled and elderly adults,

      elderly people) and the lack of political consensus on the direction
      reform should take. Fundamental demographic and societal change over the

    Research by Chadwick has influenced research protocols and policies
      regarding the ethical consequences of collecting DNA for research. Her
      impact is most visible in the Personal Genome Project, and the work of the
      Nuffield Council on Bioethics, UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, Human
      Genome Project and H3Africa. Her contributions to discussions and

      particular, the changes address important issues that she raised regarding
      the practicality and acceptability of the undertakings made in current
      consent protocols about confidentiality and the future use of data.
      Chadwick's underpinning research claims relate to the fact that genetic
      information, and the attendant genetic technology, are derived from, and
      significant to, populations as a whole. She maintains that
      biotechnological advances are changing our ethical values, particularly
      regarding conflicts between personal interests and large-group needs. For
      her, practical ethics cannot apply normative ethical concepts and theories
      arising from abstract philosophical reasoning. Rather, the conceptual and
      theoretical structures themselves must be developed through philosophical
      engagement with the scientific details of the project. Her collaboration
      with bodies responsible for the protocols of consent reflects a

      challenging behaviour, conflicts with staff and other residents, and

    ","
    The applied research generated has targeted practitioners and athletes at
      all levels, and by combining expertise and knowledge from different areas
      (primarily Biomechanics and Physiology), aimed to directly influence the
      way in which muscle function is assessed in competitive sports. The
      studies in the area of muscle conditioning and function has generated a
      body of work that has the potential to be useful to coaches both in
      competition as well as in training, but to date has not been fully
      realised. By examining how the muscle responds to certain stimuli,
      training suggestions have been provided that can acutely increase the
      performance of an athlete, for example conditioning stimuli prior to
      athletics performance (reference 4 in section 3). These suggestions can
      assist both in improving the competitive performance as well as in
      improving the quality of the content and experience of training sessions.
    Further, evaluating a range of tests and assessment tools, such as by
      examining their validity and reliability, monitoring and assessment
      becomes much more accurate and sport-specific, enabling high-quality
      training (such as in reference 2, section 3). In addition, as these
      assessments allow testing to take place within the training and
      performance environment the performer is accustomed to (such as in
      reference 6, section 3), they also result in minimal disruption of the
      training programme, which cannot be achieved using traditional assessment
      techniques which require a visit to a laboratory for the assessment to
      take place.
    The range of applicability of the research to support uptake of the
      recommendations and resultant training and performance benefits has been
      maximised by ensuring the suggestions and equipment used are low cost and
      easily accessible, enabling coaches and athletes from a wide range of
      performance levels to utilise them, such as functional tests (such as in
      reference 5, section 3). The work has highlighted that coaches and
      athletes need to reassess their approaches to measuring performance and

    Establishing the Medical Humanities movement in the UK and influencing
        the education of healthcare professionals
    ","
    The field of medicine has become more complex and morally demanding as it
      faces the challenges of technological advances, changing social attitudes
      and financial constraints, all dramatically highlighted in the recent
      Francis Report. These challenges require a profession with independent
      judgment and a willingness to listen to, and communicate humanely with,
      patients. The complex skills required for this can be developed through
      what have become known as the `medical humanities', or the application of
      philosophy and other humanities to medical education.
    This argument was first explored and tested in the UK by researchers at
      the University of Glasgow (UoG), where the key actors in the UK medical
      humanities movement worked together to articulate and trial humanities
      content to students of medicine.
    The impact this can have on medical practice has been recognised by the
      General Medical Council, funding streams in the Wellcome Trust and other
      major funding bodies, the Royal Colleges and NHS units. From the
      pioneering work at Glasgow, there are, as of 2013, five centres of medical
      humanities in the UK and 24 in total worldwide, and humanities content is
      delivered to medical students at module or degree level in 30 of the UK's
      32 medical schools.

    Since 2000 the Child and Woman Abuse Studies Centre (CWASU) has produced
      a body of research that has had significant impact for victim-survivors of
      violence against women (VAW) at policy and practice levels. We have
      evaluated new and emerging forms of support provision (Sexual Assault
      Referral Centres), tracked attrition in criminal justice responses to rape
      in England, Wales and Europe, mapped the `postcode lottery' of specialist
      services across Great Britain, and developed minimum standards for
      specialist services across Europe. Our research highlighted promising
      practices that led to a national rollout of specific forms of provision
      and central government funding for specialist services. We were among the
      first researchers in the UK to draw on human rights principles to
      illuminate the responsibilities of states to provide services, principles
      further elaborated in the 2011 Council of Europe Convention. Evidence here
      demonstrates that responses to victim-survivors across a number of arenas
      &#8212; criminal justice, specialist NGOs, and statutory health agencies &#8212; have
      been enhanced at an unprecedented level because of our work. More widely,
      our research has rekindled scholarship on sexual violence.
    CWASU's role as independent academics... is crucial for both the
        voluntary and community sector and for statutory bodies like the Mayor's
        Office for Policing and Crime. They understand the issues on the ground

Safeguarding women from occupational exposure to breast cancer
carcinogens
","
Research on the relationship between women's working lives, occupational exposures and breast
cancer, which uses detailed work histories as a means of identifying toxic exposures, has found
there to be an elevated risk for women working in agriculture, bars and gambling environments, as
well as automotive plastics manufacturing, food canning, and metalworking workplaces. The
influential study has led trade unions, politicians and charities in the United Kingdom and Canada
to demand health and safety regulatory changes and further research.
A number of studies have been produced by the multidisciplinary, multinational team, in which
Professor Matthias Beck plays a lead role. The main study was published and released to the
media in 2012 (Brophy et al. 2012b); so far it has attracted more than 16,000 downloads and over
220 media references.

    UNICEF estimate that over 3,500 children die annually from abuse and
      neglect in economically developed countries, including 100 in the UK of
      whom around 4 are from Northern Ireland. Although the number of deaths
      appears to be falling in the UK, the rate of decline is slowing. This case
      study describes the impact of three related pieces of research undertaken
      for the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Commissioner
      for Children and Young People. The aim was to identify the things that
      policy makers and practitioners could do differently in order to protect
      children better, and has led to significant improvements into how reviews
      are undertaken, and in the child protection policies and practices in
      Northern Ireland. As a result children have been better protected by child

    Stroke is the leading cause of disability in Europe. There are around 1.2
      million stroke survivors in the UK. More than half have been left with
      disabilities that affect their daily life.
    The annual cost of stroke to the UK economy was &#163;8.9 billion. Clinical
      response to stroke has often focused on resulting physical disabilities,
      but cognitive disability can be an equally substantial source of
      difficulty for patients and their carers. Sensitive and reliable
      assessment of cognitive disability following stroke is essential for
      identifying these needs in patients, and early assessment is a major
      benefit because problems soon after stroke are a strong prognostic
      indicator of future problems, and appropriate rehabilitation is most
      effective when started early.
    Founded on longstanding expertise in neuropsychological studies, the
        University of Birmingham group has developed a comprehensive
        stroke-specific screening tool (the BCoS), which enables early and
        efficient detection of cognitive impairment after a stroke for a wider

    The worst of institutional child care came to the attention of the public

      1990s following the fall of Ceau&#351;escu in 1989 when pictures of children in
      Romanian orphanages
      were broadcast around Europe and America. Following this, a series of
      projects at the University of
      Birmingham (funded by the European Union Daphne programme and the World
      Health
      Organisation Regional Office for Europe) charted the extent and
      consequences of institutionalised
      care for children across Europe, and devised best practice recommendations
      for
      deinstitutionalisation. Among the key findings were that
      institutionalisation was much more
      widespread across the EU than previously thought; that it is particularly
      harmful before the age of
      three; and that alternative care with superior outcomes for children is
      also less expensive to
      implement. During the REF period the research team has significantly
      expanded their role in
      disseminating their findings, producing policy reports and briefings, and
      in providing training.
      During this time their key findings have made a major contribution to

      discussion at the

    5: Improving treatment for personality disorders
    ","
    People with personality disorders (PD) have enduring and serious
      difficulties in relating to others and their treatment remains one of the
      most challenging areas in psychiatry. Until recently, service provision
      for such individuals was extremely variable in both quality and quantity.
      Research at King's College London (KCL) has helped highlight the
      considerable public health and economic impacts of personality disorders
      and has had a significant impact on current treatment guidelines in the
      UK. KCL research also led to the development of a brief and simple
      screening test for personality disorders &#8212; the Standard Assessment of
      Personality Abbreviated Scale (SAPAS) &#8212; which is now recommended for use
      in the UK Government's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies
      initiative, under which nearly a million patients a year are seen.

    Bulimic eating disorders are disabling conditions affecting approximately

    Research into point of sale tobacco marketing (POS) by the Institute for
      Social Marketing (ISM), based in Stirling Management School contributed
      directly to the passage of the 2009 Health Act (England and Wales)
      and the Tobacco &amp; Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010,
      and was instrumental in defending this and equivalent legislation in
      Norway and Ireland from legal challenge. The UK acts build on ISM research
      showing that in-shop displays influence consumer behaviour and
      independently encourage the onset of youth smoking; they require tobacco
      products to be out of sight at PoS.

      on legal asylum in the USA. It has been used directly by governmental
      policymakers in Rwanda and Bangladesh and aid organisations in Africa and
      Asia, and has formed the basis for the development of new learning and
      advocacy resources used to improve the services offered by social work
      professionals in Africa, Asia and the UK. Through its direct impact on
      these individuals and organisations, the research has delivered indirect

      response to the `obesity epidemic'. Its impact has reset the parameters of

    Redeeming Power: Overcoming Abuse in Church and Society
    ","
    In Autumn 2011, Dr Stephen Bullivant was appointed Director of the
      European Society for Catholic Theology's research project into 'the
      nature, function and location of theology, with particular attention to
      the power of theology to overcome power abuse in Church and Society'
      (InSpiRe 2013), and with a special focus on the nature and causes of
      clerical sexual abuse.
    Given the gravity and urgency of the topic, the project's 'impact aims'
      have been to engage two particular non-academic audiences: the Catholic
      hierarchy, and those involved in setting church policy regarding
      safeguarding and the handling of abuse allegations; and the wider Catholic
      public (i.e., the Church as a whole). Its intention is to introduce both
      to the wealth of academic research being conducted in this area, and from
      which the Church can and must learn.
    Although the research project was only recently concluded &#8212; and several
      of the main outputs have yet to appear &#8212; a significant amount of both
      kinds of impact has, even at this very early stage, already occurred.
      Since the project launch in September 2012, major figures from the world
      of Catholic safeguarding, at both national and international levels have
      been involved in various ways. Most notably, the Vatican's own chief
      prosecutor of abuse allegations has described the project as constituting
      'an important moment to move from the hierarchy to the theologians' for
      proper reflection 'on this most tragic wound in the Church and in society'
      (Vatican Radio 2012a; 2012b; see section 4, below). The project has also
      received notable coverage from the international Catholic media.

    The further development of the UK Physical Activity guidelines in 2010

      group, drawing on the
      original work of Biddle and co-workers, set out clear recommendations for
      the incorporation of
      sedentary behaviour into the UK national Physical Activity Guidelines
      through the `Sedentary
      Behaviour and Obesity: Review of the Current Scientific Evidence' report
      (2010).
