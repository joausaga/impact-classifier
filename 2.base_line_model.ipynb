    "The project proposes to leverage machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build a text classifier that automatizes the processing and identification of evidence of social impact in research documents. The proposal aims to solve a classification problem in which the model takes a sentence contained in a research document as input and produces as output a binary answer (1=True, 0=False) that states whether the sentence contains or not evidence of social impact, respectively.\n",
