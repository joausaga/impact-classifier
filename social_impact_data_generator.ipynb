    "In this project, I propose to leverage machine learning and natural language processing techniques to build a text classifier that automatizes the processing and identification of evidence of social impact in research documents. The proposal aims to solve  a classification problem in which the model takes a sentence as input and produces as output a binary answer (1=True, 0=False) that states whether the sentence contains or not evidence of social impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input of the machine learning model will be sentences of the research documents and the output will be whether or not the sentence provides evidence of social impact. Therefore, training a machine-learning algorithm to automatically identify evidence of social impact in text documents requires having a dataset of examples of sentences that provide evidence of impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I try a couple techniques, namely sentiment analysis and k-means, to see whether I can automatize part of process of generating the data set to train and test our classifier. The idea of using sentiment analysis is to focus the manual processing only on sentences with a positive tone since it is expected that sentences with evidence of social impact are written in a positive tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final dataset will include both sentences that contain evidence of social impact of research and sentences that do not contain evidence of social impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "Summaries of the societal impact of Medical, Health, and Biological research published by the Research Excellence Framework (REF)---REF is the evaluation system used in the United Kingdom to measure the quality of research of their higher education institutions---will be used to build the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "From all research fields, this project focuses on Medical, Health, and Biological science because the ultimately goal is to understand the social impact of the research projects of the Spanish National Institue of Bioinformatics (INB by its Spanish Acronym), which is an institution that conducts medical and biological investigations."
