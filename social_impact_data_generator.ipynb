    "The project proposes to leverage machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build a text classifier that automatizes the processing and identification of evidence of social impact in research documents. The proposal aims to solve  a classification problem in which the model takes a sentence contained in a research document as input and produces as output a binary answer (1=True, 0=False) that states whether the sentence contains or not evidence of social impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, training a machine-learning algorithm to automatically identify evidence of social impact in text documents requires having a dataset of examples of sentences that provide evidence of impact. In this notebook, I experiment with **Sentiment Analysis** and **K-means** to see whether they can be useful to automatize part of process of generating a data set of sentences with evidence of social impact. The reason of using Sentiment Analysis is to automatically identify sentences with evidence of social impact, which are expected to be written in a positive tone. The use of K-means is motivated by the fact that having assistance in pre-processing the sentences in topic-alike groups can facilitate the posterior identification of evidence of social impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final dataset should include both sentences that contain evidence of social impact of research and sentences that do not contain evidence of social impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summaries of the societal impact of Medical, Health, and Biological research published by the Research Excellence Framework (REF)---REF is the evaluation system used in the United Kingdom to measure the quality of research of their higher education institutions---will be used to build the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "From all research fields, this project focuses on Medical, Health, and Biological science because the ultimately goal is to understand the social impact of the research projects of the Spanish National Institue of Bioinformatics (INB by its Spanish Acronym), which is an institution that conducts medical and biological investigations."
